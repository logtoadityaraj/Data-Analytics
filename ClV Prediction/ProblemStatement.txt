Predict Customer Life-time Value for an Auto Insurance Company  
 
Objective: 

1) For an Auto Insurance company, predict the customer life time value (CLV). 
   CLV is the total revenue the client will derive from their entire relationship with a customer.
   Because we don't know how long each customer relationship will be, we make a good estimate and 
   state CLV as a periodic value — that is, we usually say “this customer's 12-month (or 24-month, etc) CLV is $x”. 
   
2) The client also wants to know the types of customers that would generally give us more revenue.
